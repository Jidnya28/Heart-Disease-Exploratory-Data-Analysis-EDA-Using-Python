# Heart-Disease-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Using-Python

🩺 Problem Statement:

The project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to uncover patterns and correlations between clinical health indicators (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate) and the presence of cardiovascular disease.
Through statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, the goal is to identify significant risk factors influencing heart disease and derive actionable insights that could support predictive modeling and early diagnosis in healthcare analytics.


📄 Project Description:

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to identify key health indicators associated with cardiovascular conditions.
The analysis focuses on understanding the relationships between patient attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, and heart rate with the likelihood of heart disease.

💡 Key Insights:

Gender-based trends: Males show a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to females.

Chest pain correlation: Specific chest pain types (cp = 1, 2) are strongly linked with heart disease occurrence.

Heart rate patterns: Patients with lower maximum heart rate (thalach) tend to have a higher disease risk.

Feature correlations: cp, thalach, and slope are positively correlated with disease presence, while oldpeak, ca, and thal show negative correlations.

Age and cholesterol: Majority of affected individuals fall between 45–60 years, with higher cholesterol levels indicating elevated risk.
