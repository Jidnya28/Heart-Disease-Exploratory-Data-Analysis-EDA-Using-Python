# Heart-Disease-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Using-Python

🩺 Problem Statement:

The project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to uncover patterns and correlations between clinical health indicators (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate) and the presence of cardiovascular disease.
Through statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, the goal is to identify significant risk factors influencing heart disease and derive actionable insights that could support predictive modeling and early diagnosis in healthcare analytics.
📄 Project Description:

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to identify key health indicators associated with cardiovascular conditions.
The analysis focuses on understanding the relationships between patient attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, and heart rate with the likelihood of heart disease.
